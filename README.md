# Neopixel Controller

## Summary
WS2812Bs, more commonly referred to by Adafruit's name for them (Neopixels) have quickly become one of the most popular ways to add complex lighting to hobbyist projects. These addressable LEDs can be found in a wide variety of projects, ranging from room lighting to cosplay.

The issue, though, is that they are not user friendly. While the open-source community has made great strides developing libraries to interface with these LEDs and abstract away most of their complex serial interface, there are still shortcomings. For starters, many Arduion and similar development boards are not optimized for use with LEDs, reuqiring the construction of additional circutiry to make them useable. Beyond that, the barrier of use for Arduino or Micropython programming is relatively high, especially for someone looking to simply make a first electronics project.

To solve these issues, the Neopixel Controller was developed. This robust hardware...
